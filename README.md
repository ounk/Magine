# Magine
The json object gets loaded and parsed into an ArrayList of custom class Movie by a background task. Afterwards this background task loads all thumbs from the internet into the ArrayList. 
Then a custom ArrayAdapter displays all data and the image in a list view. 
When the user clicks on a list item the video gets played by intent. 

No 3rd-party libraries needed.
